     ffiinndd -- walk a file hierarchy

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ffiinndd [--HH | --LL | --PP] [--EEXXddssxx] [--ff _p_a_t_h] _p_a_t_h _._._. [_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ffiinndd utility recursively descends the directory tree for each _p_a_t_h
     listed, evaluating an _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n (composed of the ``primaries'' and
     ``operands'' listed below) in terms of each file in the tree.

     The options are as follows:

     --EE      Interpret regular expressions followed by --rreeggeexx and --iirreeggeexx pri-
             maries as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic
             regular expressions (BRE's).  The re_format(7) manual page fully
             describes both formats.

     --HH      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link specified on the command line to be those
             of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself.  If the
             referenced file does not exist, the file information and type
             will be for the link itself.  File information of all symbolic
             links not on the command line is that of the link itself.

     --LL      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the
             link, not the link itself.  If the referenced file does not
             exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.

             This option is equivalent to the deprecated --ffoollllooww primary.

     --PP      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself.  This is
             the default.

     --XX      Permit ffiinndd to be safely used in conjunction with xargs(1).  If a
             file name contains any of the delimiting characters used by
             xargs(1), a diagnostic message is displayed on standard error,
             and the file is skipped.  The delimiting characters include sin-
             gle (`` ' '') and double (`` " '') quotes, backslash (``\''),
             space, tab and newline characters.

             However, you may wish to consider the --pprriinntt00 primary in conjunc-
             tion with ``xxaarrggss --00'' as an effective alternative.

     --dd      Cause ffiinndd to perform a depth-first traversal, i.e., directories
             are visited in post-order and all entries in a directory will be
             acted on before the directory itself.  By default, ffiinndd visits
             directories in pre-order, i.e., before their contents.  Note, the
             default is _n_o_t a breadth-first traversal.

             This option is equivalent to the --ddeepptthh primary of IEEE Std
             1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').  The --dd option can be useful when ffiinndd
             is used with cpio(1) to process files that are contained in
             directories with unusual permissions.  It ensures that you have
             write permission while you are placing files in a directory, then
             sets the directory's permissions as the last thing.

     --ff      Specify a file hierarchy for ffiinndd to traverse.  File hierarchies
             may also be specified as the operands immediately following the
             options.

     --ss      Cause ffiinndd to traverse the file hierarchies in lexicographical
             order, i.e., alphabetical order within each directory.  Note:
             `find -s' and `find | sort' may give different results.

     --xx      Prevent ffiinndd from descending into directories that have a device
             number different than that of the file from which the descent
             began.

             This option is equivalent to the deprecated --xxddeevv primary.

PPRRIIMMAARRIIEESS
     All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number to be pre-
     ceded by a plus sign (``+'') or a minus sign (``-'').  A preceding plus
     sign means ``more than n'', a preceding minus sign means ``less than n''
     and neither means ``exactly n''.

     --BBmmiinn _n
             True if the difference between the time of a file's inode cre-
             ation and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full
             minute, is _n minutes.

     --BBnneewweerr _f_i_l_e
             Same as --nneewweerrBBmm.

     --BBttiimmee _n[ssmmhhddww]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of a file's inode creation and the
             time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour
             period, is _n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of a file's inode creation and the
             time ffiinndd was started is exactly _n units.  Please refer to the
             --aattiimmee primary description for information on supported time
             units.

     --aaccll    May be used in conjunction with other primaries to locate files
             with extended ACLs.  See acl(3) for more information.

     --aammiinn _n
             True if the difference between the file last access time and the
             time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full minute, is _n
             minutes.

     --aanneewweerr _f_i_l_e
             Same as --nneewweerraamm.

     --aattiimmee _n[ssmmhhddww]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the file last access time and the time ffiinndd
             was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour period, is _n
             24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the file last access time and the time ffiinndd
             was started is exactly _n units.  Possible time units are as fol-
             lows:

             ss       second
             mm       minute (60 seconds)
             hh       hour (60 minutes)
             dd       day (24 hours)
             ww       week (7 days)

             Any number of units may be combined in one --aattiimmee argument, for
             example, ``-atime -1h30m''.  Units are probably only useful when
             used in conjunction with the ++ or -- modifier.

     --ccmmiinn _n
             True if the difference between the time of last change of file
             status information and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to
             the next full minute, is _n minutes.

     --ccnneewweerr _f_i_l_e
             Same as --nneewweerrccmm.

     --ccttiimmee _n[ssmmhhddww]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of last change of file status infor-
             mation and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full
             24-hour period, is _n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of last change of file status infor-
             mation and the time ffiinndd was started is exactly _n units.  Please
             refer to the --aattiimmee primary description for information on sup-
             ported time units.

     --dd      Same as ddeepptthh.  GNU find implements this as a primary in mistaken
             emulation of FreeBSD find(1).

     --ddeelleettee
             Delete found files and/or directories.  Always returns true.
             This executes from the current working directory as ffiinndd recurses
             down the tree.  It will not attempt to delete a filename with a
             ``_/'' character in its pathname relative to ``_.'' for security
             reasons.  Depth-first traversal processing is implied by this
             option.  Following symlinks is incompatible with this option.

     --ddeepptthh  Always true; same as the --dd option.

     --ddeepptthh _n
             True if the depth of the file relative to the starting point of
             the traversal is _n.

     --eemmppttyy  True if the current file or directory is empty.

     --eexxeecc _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             True if the program named _u_t_i_l_i_t_y returns a zero value as its
             exit status.  Optional _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s may be passed to the utility.
             The expression must be terminated by a semicolon (``;'').  If you
             invoke ffiinndd from a shell you may need to quote the semicolon if
             the shell would otherwise treat it as a control operator.  If the
             string ``{}'' appears anywhere in the utility name or the argu-
             ments it is replaced by the pathname of the current file.
             _U_t_i_l_i_t_y will be executed from the directory from which ffiinndd was
             executed.  _U_t_i_l_i_t_y and _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s are not subject to the further
             expansion of shell patterns and constructs.

     --eexxeecc _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] {} +
             Same as --eexxeecc, except that ``{}'' is replaced with as many path-
             names as possible for each invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  This behaviour
             is similar to that of xargs(1).

     --eexxeeccddiirr _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             The --eexxeeccddiirr primary is identical to the --eexxeecc primary with the
             exception that _u_t_i_l_i_t_y will be executed from the directory that
             holds the current file.  The filename substituted for the string
             ``{}'' is not qualified.

     --eexxeeccddiirr _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] {} +
             Same as --eexxeeccddiirr, except that ``{}'' is replaced with as many
             pathnames as possible for each invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  This be-
             haviour is similar to that of xargs(1).

     --ffllaaggss [--|++]_f_l_a_g_s,_n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s
             The flags are specified using symbolic names (see chflags(1)).
             Those with the "no" prefix (except "nodump") are said to be
             _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s.  Flags in _f_l_a_g_s are checked to be set, and flags in
             _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s are checked to be not set.  Note that this is different
             from --ppeerrmm, which only allows the user to specify mode bits that
             are set.

             If flags are preceded by a dash (``-''), this primary evaluates
             to true if at least all of the bits in _f_l_a_g_s and none of the bits
             in _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s are set in the file's flags bits.  If flags are pre-
             ceded by a plus (``+''), this primary evaluates to true if any of
             the bits in _f_l_a_g_s is set in the file's flags bits, or any of the
             bits in _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s is not set in the file's flags bits.  Otherwise,
             this primary evaluates to true if the bits in _f_l_a_g_s exactly match
             the file's flags bits, and none of the _f_l_a_g_s bits match those of
             _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s.

     --ffssttyyppee _t_y_p_e
             True if the file is contained in a file system of type _t_y_p_e.  The
             lsvfs(1) command can be used to find out the types of file sys-
             tems that are available on the system.  In addition, there are
             two pseudo-types, ``local'' and ``rdonly''.  The former matches
             any file system physically mounted on the system where the ffiinndd
             is being executed and the latter matches any file system which is
             mounted read-only.

     --ggiidd _g_n_a_m_e
             The same thing as _-_g_r_o_u_p _g_n_a_m_e for compatibility with GNU find.
             GNU find imposes a restriction that _g_n_a_m_e is numeric, while
             find(1) does not.

     --ggrroouupp _g_n_a_m_e
             True if the file belongs to the group _g_n_a_m_e.  If _g_n_a_m_e is numeric
             and there is no such group name, then _g_n_a_m_e is treated as a group
             ID.

     --iiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee
             This option is for GNU find compatibility and is ignored.

     --iillnnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --llnnaammee, but the match is case insensitive.  This is a GNU
             find extension.

     --iinnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --nnaammee, but the match is case insensitive.

     --iinnuumm _n
             True if the file has inode number _n.

     --iippaatthh _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --ppaatthh, but the match is case insensitive.

     --iirreeggeexx _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --rreeggeexx, but the match is case insensitive.

     --iiwwhhoolleennaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             The same thing as --iippaatthh, for GNU find compatibility.

     --lliinnkkss _n
             True if the file has _n links.

     --llnnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --nnaammee, but the contents of the symbolic link are matched
             instead of the file name.  This is a GNU find extension.

     --llss     This primary always evaluates to true.  The following information
             for the current file is written to standard output: its inode
             number, size in 512-byte blocks, file permissions, number of hard
             links, owner, group, size in bytes, last modification time, and
             pathname.  If the file is a block or character special file, the
             device number will be displayed instead of the size in bytes.  If
             the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to file
             will be displayed preceded by ``->''.  The format is identical to
             that produced by ``llss --ddggiillss''.

     --mmaaxxddeepptthh _n
             Always true; descend at most _n directory levels below the command
             line arguments.  If any --mmaaxxddeepptthh primary is specified, it
             applies to the entire expression even if it would not normally be
             evaluated.  ``--mmaaxxddeepptthh 0'' limits the whole search to the com-
             mand line arguments.

     --mmiinnddeepptthh _n
             Always true; do not apply any tests or actions at levels less
             than _n.  If any --mmiinnddeepptthh primary is specified, it applies to the
             entire expression even if it would not normally be evaluated.
             ``--mmiinnddeepptthh 1'' processes all but the command line arguments.

     --mmmmiinn _n
             True if the difference between the file last modification time
             and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full
             minute, is _n minutes.

     --mmnneewweerr _f_i_l_e
             Same as --nneewweerr.

     --mmoouunntt  The same thing as --xxddeevv, for GNU find compatibility.

     --mmttiimmee _n[ssmmhhddww]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the file last modification time and the time
             ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour period, is
             _n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the file last modification time and the time
             ffiinndd was started is exactly _n units.  Please refer to the --aattiimmee
             primary description for information on supported time units.

     --nnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches
             _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Special shell pattern matching characters (``['',
             ``]'', ``*'', and ``?'') may be used as part of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  These
             characters may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a
             backslash (``\'').

     --nneewweerr _f_i_l_e
             True if the current file has a more recent last modification time
             than _f_i_l_e.

     --nneewweerr_X_Y _f_i_l_e
             True if the current file has a more recent last access time
             (_X=aa), inode creation time (_X=BB), change time (_X=cc), or modifica-
             tion time (_X=mm) than the last access time (_Y=aa), inode creation
             time (_Y=BB), change time (_Y=cc), or modification time (_Y=mm) of
             _f_i_l_e.  In addition, if _Y=tt, then _f_i_l_e is instead interpreted as a
             direct date specification of the form understood by cvs(1).  Note
             that --nneewweerrmmmm is equivalent to --nneewweerr.

     --nnooggrroouupp
             True if the file belongs to an unknown group.

     --nnooiiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee
             This option is for GNU find compatibility and is ignored.

     --nnoolleeaaff
             This option is for GNU find compatibility.  In GNU find it dis-
             ables an optimization not relevant to find(1), so it is ignored.

     --nnoouusseerr
             True if the file belongs to an unknown user.

     --ookk _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             The --ookk primary is identical to the --eexxeecc primary with the excep-
             tion that ffiinndd requests user affirmation for the execution of the
             _u_t_i_l_i_t_y by printing a message to the terminal and reading a
             response.  If the response is not affirmative (`y' in the
             ``POSIX'' locale), the command is not executed and the value of
             the --ookk expression is false.

     --ookkddiirr _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             The --ookkddiirr primary is identical to the --eexxeeccddiirr primary with the
             same exception as described for the --ookk primary.

     --ppaatthh _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             True if the pathname being examined matches _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Special
             shell pattern matching characters (``['', ``]'', ``*'', and
             ``?'') may be used as part of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  These characters may be
             matched explicitly by escaping them with a backslash (``\'').
             Slashes (``/'') are treated as normal characters and do not have
             to be matched explicitly.

     --ppeerrmm [--|++]_m_o_d_e
             The _m_o_d_e may be either symbolic (see chmod(1)) or an octal num-
             ber.  If the _m_o_d_e is symbolic, a starting value of zero is
             assumed and the _m_o_d_e sets or clears permissions without regard to
             the process' file mode creation mask.  If the _m_o_d_e is octal, only
             bits 07777 (S_ISUID | S_ISGID | S_ISTXT | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG |
             S_IRWXO) of the file's mode bits participate in the comparison.
             If the _m_o_d_e is preceded by a dash (``-''), this primary evaluates
             to true if at least all of the bits in the _m_o_d_e are set in the
             file's mode bits.  If the _m_o_d_e is preceded by a plus (``+''),
             this primary evaluates to true if any of the bits in the _m_o_d_e are
             set in the file's mode bits.  Otherwise, this primary evaluates
             to true if the bits in the _m_o_d_e exactly match the file's mode
             bits.  Note, the first character of a symbolic mode may not be a
             dash (``-'').

     --pprriinntt  This primary always evaluates to true.  It prints the pathname of
             the current file to standard output.  If none of --eexxeecc, --llss,
             --pprriinntt, --pprriinntt00, or --ookk is specified, the given expression shall
             be effectively replaced by (( _g_i_v_e_n _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n )) --pprriinntt.

     --pprriinntt00
             This primary always evaluates to true.  It prints the pathname of
             the current file to standard output, followed by an ASCII NUL
             character (character code 0).

     --pprruunnee  This primary always evaluates to true.  It causes ffiinndd to not
             descend into the current file.  Note, the --pprruunnee primary has no
             effect if the --dd option was specified.

     --rreeggeexx _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             True if the whole path of the file matches _p_a_t_t_e_r_n using regular
             expression.  To match a file named ``_._/_f_o_o_/_x_y_z_z_y'', you can use
             the regular expression ``.*/[xyz]*'' or ``.*/foo/.*'', but not
             ``xyzzy'' or ``/foo/''.

     --ssaammeeffiillee _n_a_m_e
             True if the file is a hard link to _n_a_m_e.  If the command option
             --LL is specified, it is also true if the file is a symbolic link
             and points to _n_a_m_e.

     --ssiizzee _n[cckkMMGGTTPP]
             True if the file's size, rounded up, in 512-byte blocks is _n.  If
             _n is followed by a cc, then the primary is true if the file's size
             is _n bytes (characters).  Similarly if _n is followed by a scale
             indicator then the file's size is compared to _n scaled as:

             kk       kilobytes (1024 bytes)
             MM       megabytes (1024 kilobytes)
             GG       gigabytes (1024 megabytes)
             TT       terabytes (1024 gigabytes)
             PP       petabytes (1024 terabytes)

     --ttyyppee _t
             True if the file is of the specified type.  Possible file types
             are as follows:

             bb       block special
             cc       character special
             dd       directory
             ff       regular file
             ll       symbolic link
             pp       FIFO
             ss       socket

     --uuiidd _u_n_a_m_e
             The same thing as _-_u_s_e_r _u_n_a_m_e for compatibility with GNU find.
             GNU find imposes a restriction that _u_n_a_m_e is numeric, while
             find(1) does not.

     --uusseerr _u_n_a_m_e
             True if the file belongs to the user _u_n_a_m_e.  If _u_n_a_m_e is numeric
             and there is no such user name, then _u_n_a_m_e is treated as a user
             ID.

     --wwhhoolleennaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             The same thing as --ppaatthh, for GNU find compatibility.

     --xxaattttrr  True if the file has any extended attributes.

     --xxaattttrrnnaammee _n_a_m_e
             True if the file has an extended attribute with the specified
             _n_a_m_e.

OOPPEERRAATTOORRSS
     The primaries may be combined using the following operators.  The opera-
     tors are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

     (( _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n ))
             This evaluates to true if the parenthesized expression evaluates
             to true.

     !! _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
     --nnoott _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
             This is the unary NOT operator.  It evaluates to true if the
             expression is false.

     --ffaallssee  Always false.
     --ttrruuee   Always true.

     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n --aanndd _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
             The --aanndd operator is the logical AND operator.  As it is implied
             by the juxtaposition of two expressions it does not have to be
             specified.  The expression evaluates to true if both expressions
             are true.  The second expression is not evaluated if the first
             expression is false.

     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n --oorr _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
             The --oorr operator is the logical OR operator.  The expression
             evaluates to true if either the first or the second expression is
             true.  The second expression is not evaluated if the first
             expression is true.

     All operands and primaries must be separate arguments to ffiinndd.  Primaries
     which themselves take arguments expect each argument to be a separate
     argument to ffiinndd.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES and LC_TIME environ-
     ment variables affect the execution of the ffiinndd utility as described in
     environ(7).

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     The following examples are shown as given to the shell:

     find / \! -name "*.c" -print
             Print out a list of all the files whose names do not end in _._c.

     find / -newer ttt -user wnj -print
             Print out a list of all the files owned by user ``wnj'' that are
             newer than the file _t_t_t.

     find / \! \( -newer ttt -user wnj \) -print
             Print out a list of all the files which are not both newer than
             _t_t_t and owned by ``wnj''.

     find / \( -newer ttt -or -user wnj \) -print
             Print out a list of all the files that are either owned by
             ``wnj'' or that are newer than _t_t_t.

     find / -newerct '1 minute ago' -print
             Print out a list of all the files whose inode change time is more
             recent than the current time minus one minute.

     find / -type f -exec echo {} \;
             Use the echo(1) command to print out a list of all the files.

     find -L /usr/ports/packages -type l -exec rm -- {} +
             Delete all broken symbolic links in _/_u_s_r_/_p_o_r_t_s_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s.

     find /usr/src -name CVS -prune -o -depth +6 -print
             Find files and directories that are at least seven levels deep in
             the working directory _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c.

     find /usr/src -name CVS -prune -o -mindepth 7 -print
             Is not equivalent to the previous example, since --pprruunnee is not
             evaluated below level seven.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     The --ffoollllooww primary is deprecated; the --LL option should be used instead.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ffiinndd utility syntax is a superset of the syntax specified by the IEEE
     Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'') standard.

     All the single character options except --HH and --LL as well as --aammiinn,
     --aanneewweerr, --ccmmiinn, --ccnneewweerr, --ddeelleettee, --eemmppttyy, --ffssttyyppee, --iinnaammee, --iinnuumm,
     --iirreeggeexx, --llss, --mmaaxxddeepptthh, --mmiinnddeepptthh, --mmmmiinn, --ppaatthh, --pprriinntt00, --rreeggeexx and all
     of the --BB** birthtime related primaries are extensions to IEEE Std
     1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').

     Historically, the --dd, --LL and --xx options were implemented using the pri-
     maries --ddeepptthh, --ffoollllooww, and --xxddeevv.  These primaries always evaluated to
     true.  As they were really global variables that took effect before the
     traversal began, some legal expressions could have unexpected results.
     An example is the expression --pprriinntt --oo --ddeepptthh.  As --pprriinntt always evalu-
     ates to true, the standard order of evaluation implies that --ddeepptthh would
     never be evaluated.  This is not the case.

     The operator --oorr was implemented as --oo, and the operator --aanndd was imple-
     mented as --aa.

     Historic implementations of the --eexxeecc and --ookk primaries did not replace
     the string ``{}'' in the utility name or the utility arguments if it had
     preceding or following non-whitespace characters.  This version replaces
     it no matter where in the utility name or arguments it appears.

     The --EE option was inspired by the equivalent grep(1) and sed(1) options.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A ffiinndd command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

BBUUGGSS
     The special characters used by ffiinndd are also special characters to many
     shell programs.  In particular, the characters ``*'', ``['', ``]'',
     ``?'', ``('', ``)'', ``!'', ``\'' and ``;'' may have to be escaped from
     the shell.

     As there is no delimiter separating options and file names or file names
     and the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n, it is difficult to specify files named _-_x_d_e_v or _!.
     These problems are handled by the --ff option and the getopt(3) ``----'' con-
     struct.

     The --ddeelleettee primary does not interact well with other options that cause
     the file system tree traversal options to be changed.

     The --mmiinnddeepptthh and --mmaaxxddeepptthh primaries are actually global options (as
     documented above).  They should probably be replaced by options which
     look like options.
